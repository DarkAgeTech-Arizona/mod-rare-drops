## What is Rare Drops?

This module adds thematically appropriate green and blue loot drops to ALL 450 Classic rares in Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdoms.

Rares get mostly new green drops.

Rare elites get mostly neww blue drops.

Rares/rare elites which already guarantee a good drop such as the Scarlet Monastary rare spawns were not changed.

## Tell Me More

This module adds thematically appropriate green and blue loot to all Classic rares in Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdoms for 3.3.5 Azerothcore (may work for other cores too).

In TBC and Wrath content, rares have loot tables that consist of mixed blue items. In Catacalysm, all rares in the game drop semi-unique blue items.

Example One:

Sriskulk is a lvl 13 rare in Tirisfal glades which has no special or specific loot by default.

https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/npc=10359/sriskulk

This module gives it a 100% chance to drop a Spinner Fang, a level 13 green / uncommon spider themed dagger.

https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/item=2664/spinner-fang

This item is otherwise unavailable to players but is in the DB and requires no client-side patch.

Example Two: 

Siege Golem is a lvl 40 rare elite in Badlands who usually has zero loot.

https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/npc=2749/siege-golem

He will now drop Obsidian Cleaver, a lvl 35 blue / rare axe.

https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/item=9383/obsidian-cleaver

This was chosen because he has the same modelID as the Obsidian Sentinel in Uldaman, which is a dungeon in the badlands. Uldaman has various obsidian deposit references and the Obsidian Cleaver also drops from golems inside Uldaman

Rinse and repeat for all ~450 rares & rare elites which did not previously have any special loot.

Each item added to the loot tables was selected by hand to be -

a) Level Appropriate
b) Thematic and Specific to Each Mob
c) Balanced

This module represents 100+ hours of work. You can imagine taking 10 minutes per mob for all 450 mobs quickly becomes 4500 minutes (75 hours) plus testing.
